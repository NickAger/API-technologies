GraphQL, Rest + swagger etc

* New Book from John Resig, the GraphQL Guide [graphql.guide](https://graphql.guide) [hacker news discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17289048) - "Its the new rest"
* [Tutorial: Designing a GraphQL API](https://gist.github.com/swalkinshaw/3a33e2d292b60e68fcebe12b62bbb3e2)
* https://www.apollographql.com
* [GRPC](https://grpc.io) - "Define your service using Protocol Buffers ... Automatically generate idiomatic client and server stubs for your service in a variety of languages and platforms"
* [swagger](https://swagger.io) - "The Best APIs are Built with Swagger Tools"
* "Why spend time building an API at all? Just point Postgrest at your PostreSQL database and you get a REST api for free. Thereâ€™s similar projects for graphql and other DBs"


## Contract checkers
* Similar to how you can specify an API using: http://maersk-api-spec.dev.mub.lu/#4.-help-4.1-faqs-get, which is rendered using [Aglio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio) which is a renderer for [api blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org) - "A powerful high-level API description language for web APIs." See Joe Armstrong's talk on [contract checkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed7A7r6DBsM#t=49.828686804)
